# Popov 
Named after the infamous spy [DuÅ¡ko Popov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du%C5%A1ko_Popov), it was supposed to be a logging and utility app
for malware and privacy analysis. it ***tries*** to log the victim's phone calls, installed apps, Notifications, and messages then send it to a backend running on PHP heavily inspired by [Dendroid](https://github.com/nyx0/Dendroid).

Sadly, with the strong measures taken by Google Play and OEM manufactures, it doesn't work on most of the current devices in the market. and most of the
things ask for the user's permission now. I have lost the backend code and the interest to continue the project. (neither did the client who asked me to do it
in the first place). you can find the client app code [here](https://github.com/YohannesTz/PopovClient) 

Open-sourcing it because people could learn from it and do their research. drop a star if you liked it
